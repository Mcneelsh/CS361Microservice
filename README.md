To request data, you must read the "outputfile.txt" file
To seperate the string of numbers, each number is seperate by a space. Use a delimiter function to break these apart into individual numbers.

To generate 6 new random numbers, you must write "run" to the "run.txt" file in all lowercase. Anything else will not work.
